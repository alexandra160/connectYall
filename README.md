For the first semester project of my second year in Univeristy, I had to work together with a team, for a Dutch company - LiveWall. 
The scope of this project is to come up with a solution to the ongoing problem of people facing a hard time finding friends/acquaintances who share the same interests as them.
The concept we are working on developing follows the idea of connecting people who have similar hobbies with eachother, with the help of an application, connectYall. The main focus is an algorithm that searches thourgh all users and checks, for those who are not already connected (with eachother) if there is at least a 50% compatibility between the two people. If so, each week, the users get three weekly matches, where they will find available people who share the same hobbies as them.
Another interesting feature of the application, is the anonimity of the users; when 2 users first become friends, they cannot see each others profile pictures - only the hobbies they share and a small description of them. Unless they both agree to do so (upon talking, for example), they can reveal their profile pictures to each other.

My contribution to this project, as a team manager, was to organise my team during the research phase, as well as during the coding process. 

During the research process, we first conducted extensive research about the problem we were approaching (lack of social interaction for people moving abroad). After analysing the problem and establishing a more narrow audience we wanted to aproach (students), we started gaining insights into the way people coped with the problem (surveys, user interviews, empathy maps, user journey). After knowing more clearly what people struggled with, as well as what they expected to see in such an app, we did many brainstorming sessions where we gathered ideas that we could include in the product we were developing. 

In order to improve the workflow of ideas and focus on creating an application that would suit all user's needs, we used the MoSCoW method to prioritize the functions we wanted our application to have, and decide how the first prototype was going to look like. Before creating the Adobe XD prototype, we sketched the wireframes, and gathered feedback from users. After changing some things based on the feedback we got, we were ready to move on with the interactive prototype, on which I worked together with two of my team-mates. It then followed another round of testing, where we used the think-aloud method based on the scenario we created beforehand. It was important that the applicato=ion was easy to use, and fulfilled all their expectations and needs.

When we had alreafy gathered enough insights and made some changes, we moved on to coding the product. I worked both on the fron-end and back-end part, but my focus in the last few months was on the back-end part. 

We tested the product one last time, and when everything was ready, we presented it to our teachers and our mentors at LiveWall. The feedback we got was positive, with them saying that they liked the amount of effort we put into researching the problem, as well as the design we came up with.

For this project it was used:

- Double-Diamond methodology;
- Sprints;
- HTML&CSS for front-end;
- EJS - a templating tool to create HTML elements only by using JavaScript;
- JavaScript for front-end and back-end;
- NodeJS (Express);
- MongoDB;
