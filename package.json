  "description": "The scope of this project is to come up with a solution to the ongoing problem of people facing a hard time finding friends/acquaintances who share the same interests as them. The concept we are working on developing follows the idea of connecting people who have similar hobbies with eachother, with the help of an application, connectYall. The main focus is an algorithm that searches thourgh all users and checks, for those who are not already connected (with eachother) if there is at least a 50% compatibility between the two people. If so, each week, the users get three weekly matches, where they will find available people who share the same hobbies as them. Another interesting feature of the application, is the anonimity of the users; when 2 users first become friends, they cannot see each others profile pictures - only the hobbies they share and a small description of them. Unless they both agree to do so (upon talking, for example), they can reveal their profile pictures to each other.",
